# Empirical Study: Road Sign Classification
Official Code for CSE 881 Fall 2024 Final Project: "Empirical Study: Road Sign Classification" Bao Hoang and Tanawan Premsri.

## Overview
 The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology has highlighted the critical need for robust road sign detection systems. This project leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning Networks to develop and evaluate models for detecting and classifying road signs. Diverse datasets, including images from Google Images, Google Shopping, and Kaggle, are collected and used to train various advanced architectures. Performance is assessed by splitting the data into training (80\%) and test (20\%) sets, with additional evaluations conducted on different data sources, such as Kaggle and Google. Furthermore, incorrect model predictions are analyzed to identify underlying causes and improve model accuracy. Our codes are provided in [https://github.com/hoangcaobao/CSE881-Fall2024-FinalProject]{https://github.com/hoangcaobao/CSE881-Fall2024-FinalProject}.

## Data preparation
### Google Data Scraping
To scrap images from Google, run ```python3 scrape.py```

### Kaggle Dataset
Please download images from the Kaggle website ([Road Sign Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection/data)) and place them in a folder named kaggle.

### Generate Synthetic Data. 

## Demos
Here we provide several demos of results in the project report.

 
## Run app
We can run the app by ```streamlit run app.py``` to run locally.
